# **Functions-Iterations-Dates-purr**

### **Question 1**

Write a function (using r code and structure demonstrated in class) to calculate a z score for a given observed value, a mean, and a standard deviation value. And then use your function to find a z score for the following problem. (Research the internet to find the formula used to calculate a z score)\
Observed value = 25.77, mean = 23.54, standard deviation = 2.442

```{r}

z_score <- function(x, mean, sd) {
  (x - mean) / sd
}

z_score(25.77, 23.54, 2.442)

```
